## Node weekly

* [WebContainer API is here](https://dub.sh/CsdNihO): StackBlitz has released the WebContainer API â€“ remember the full-stack Node.js environments in the browser? Now the API allows headless access to WebContainers, providing flexibility to build user applications on top of the WebContainers.
* [Are clouds having their on-prem moment?](https://dub.sh/nKBTICw): Ben Popper of Stack Overflow writes about the adoption of public cloud infrastructure as a trend in recent years. Long read about how financial, logistics, healthcare industries are bringing the power of the cloud to on-premise data.
* [More Elegant Destructuring with JavaScript Generators](https://dub.sh/QbSFMR9): Did you know you can deconstruct arrays from generators functions? Quick example of destructuring an arbitrary number of entities on demand for no reason (literally).
* [Writing Javascript without a build system](https://dub.sh/AOrYkGp): We all love build systems for combining files, minification, and adding polyfills? Julia Evans argues that for small projects they are unnecessary and frustrating to work with when scaling (I agree).
* [Community in a Downturn](https://dub.sh/DzYh43P): The tech industry has been hit hard by layoffs, restructuring, and shifting priorities. Erin Mikail Staples writes a four-part honest analysis of tech vs community vs industry.
