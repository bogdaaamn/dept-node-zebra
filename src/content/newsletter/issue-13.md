## Node weekly

- [JavaScript Macros in Bun](https://dub.sh/CRG623r): Field trip day for Bun fans, it supports Macros. You can now run functions at bundle-time and return the values straight into the bundle (don't ask me why tho).
- [3 ways to find your worst JavaScript offenders for page load](https://dub.sh/jFAvuog): The web performance boss Sia Karamalegos writes about how expensive JavaScript is. She gives away three methods to measure JavaScript load times and strip out offensive code. 
- [Running Promises in Parallel](https://dub.sh/BRn9AHl): A pretty visual guide to JavaScript promises. Also sprinkled with tips of how to run promises in parallel instead of mindlessly writing `await` (guilty üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
- [How open should your open source be?](https://dub.sh/EdA8m9C): Yet another beautiful ReadME Project article about finding the balance in open source. A lot of good thought about maintainers mental health, OSS viability, and abuse.
- [What is a Vector Database?](https://dub.sh/lMMK6cA): If you are also confused about vector databases ever since AI took over, here is a long explanation. And conveniently placed ad for Pinecone.
- [Some Reddit protests plan to go on](https://dub.sh/MkrTkT4): I know you know what is going on with Reddit. This is a long collection of people complaining about it on LinkedIn (as of 14 June).
