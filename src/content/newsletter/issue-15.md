## Weekly bites

* [Sharing State with Islands Architecture](https://dub.sh/nXlc0E2): If you fight to ship less JavaScript or you just like to use buzz words like "Islands Architecture" or "hydration", this one is for you. Maxi demystifies options for sharing state between hydrated components, and it's not lifting the state up *boo hoo*.
* [An Interactive Intro to CRDTs](https://dub.sh/jumD3mA): In another demystifying interactive piece, Jake Lazaroff writes about conflict-free replicated data types. The article highlights approachable code snippets implementing basic CRDT types that build collaborative and replicated data structures without a PhD in Mathematics.
* [Next.js 13 vs Remix – An In-depth case study](https://dub.sh/ve9LlXj): This month's opinion piece comparing Next.js and Remix focuses on data fetching, loading states, and transitions. Enjoy Prateek's takes on features that one framework should adopt from the other to create a supernova React framework (but then what would we complain about).
* [What codegen is (actually) good for](https://dub.sh/zoYvSnd): Bit of a Figma DevMode plug, but good takes on how codegen can assist with design implementation. Also a bit of reassurance that neither developers or designers will be replaced by AI, *yet*.
* [Security Weaknesses of Copilot Generated Code in GitHub](https://dub.sh/o2fHgUf): In this paper, Yujia Fu *et al*. have statically analysed code snippets generated by Copilot. They discovered that (only) 35.8% of Copilot generated code contains security weaknesses. But it's all good because "developers understand the security risks of weaknesses introduced in the code generated by Copilot".
* [How to be a Good Codemate](https://dub.sh/pQgckux): Quick refresher on how to be cool and avoid frustrating situations with other engineers. The article provides practical advice on communication, collaboration, and avoiding unnecessary (re-)work.
* [Tech Events are NOT as cool as you think (from an organizer perspective)](https://dub.sh/uXXP3qv): Speaking of cool, Keit writes about the untold tales of the challenges of organizing large tech events. Next time you wear a cool conference t-shirt, think about Keit.
