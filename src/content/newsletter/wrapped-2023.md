## Node Zebra _Wrapped_

Celebrating almost one year since we sent out the first Node Zebra Newsletter issue, we put together a few feats that were made possible with the effort of everyone writing, sending, and clicking stuff for and with us ü´∂üèª

- We sent out **17 issues**, featuring a total of **94 articles** and **78 tools**
- The content was **read over 1500 times** and generated **260 reactions**
- We joined **#frontend-collective** and bothered them at the end of the year
- The newsletter web archive got [**a new Deptified look**](https://zbr.fyi/newsletter) and [**an RSS feed**](https://zbr.fyi/rss)

Out of all the good content sent throughout the year, we are featuring the ones that stood out the most. The nine most read articles and clicked tools have been curated here for you to revisit (or to reflect how quick this year has passed):

- **https://zbr.fyi/wrapped-articles**
- **https://zbr.fyi/wrapped-tools**

This is the last time you‚Äôll hear from us this year, will be back fresh in 2024 and I promise we won‚Äôt cover any of the gemini, stylex, or auth0 drama ü´°

Thanks a lot for tagging along with us, see you next year! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
