## Node weekly

- [Runtime validation libraries for Typescript](https://dub.sh/Mcj8ALB): While there are hundreds (three) of validation libraries, we all agree Zod is the best option for runtime validation. Jacob goes through some of the features and highlights Zod's great API, static type inference, and small ecosystem of plugins.
- [Dissecting Npm Malware](https://dub.sh/SxXsatR): What seems to be a shameless ad for Sandworm, turns out to be an insightful article about the threats posed by `npm install`. The article highlights five packages that have been using pre and post-install scripts to run arbitrary code during the installation process on the user's machine.
- [Improve productivity through incremental automation](https://dub.sh/oKsGJbx): Are we really developers if we didn't spend 10 hours to automate a task that usually takes 20 seconds (two painfully relevant xkcd [#1205](https://dub.sh/xLh6c50) [#1319](https://dub.sh/qRj2sJA))? Seriously, Jess' article talks about how bash scripts, APIs, website automation, and GitHub Actions helps us automate mundane tasks.
- [How To Dominate Conferences Like A Boss](https://dub.sh/Q2tCDv5): Lourdes' article highlights best tips on how to actually enjoy conferences. Helps a lot with expectations management, networking tricks, and FOMO.
- [Community 2.0](https://dub.sh/epXQ7ct): Back to DevRel land, Rosie is back with a thought provoking piece about the future of online communities. While the hype of communities during pandemic is slowly fading away, she proposes a more understanding, better tooled, and higher-value approach to communities that benefits everyone involved.
